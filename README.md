# Workshop Ratings

In this repository you'll find the code for a "review" form, designed to help customers review their experience with a product. Your task is to diagnose and find solutions to accessibility problems with that form.

## Get started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create an issue called "fuck ups" and list all the accessibility issues you can find in the code, formatted like this list
3. Tip: work in the `gh-pages` branch from where you can demo and inspect the code in a browser
